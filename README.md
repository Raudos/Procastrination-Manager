# Procastrination Manager

Time tracking Android application created with React Native.

# Motivation

The aim of this application was to show my abilities in the upcoming job interviews as a Front End and JavaScript Developer.

App is not and will not be hosted on App Store. Newest compiled version is attached to this repository.
